"""
singup_view
- Django does not ship with a singup view because "how to create a user" varies per project
- A simple function-based view is the standard choice because we don't need the extra structure a class-based view brings

What the view needs to do? 
    * If it's a GET request → show a blank form
    * If it's a POST request → validate the submitted data, and either:
        - Save the new user + log them in automatically, or
        - Re-show the form with errors

        form = SignUpForm(request.POST)

        # password match, password strength — all inherited from UserCreationForm

            # this is the method we inherited for free by subclassing UserCreationForm
            user = form.save()

        # which re-shows the form — now populated with Django's validation error messages.
